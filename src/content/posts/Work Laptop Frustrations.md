I think something I'm going to have to start asking in any future jobs is, "how locked down are your company laptops?"

In my first role, I was quite lucky to be given essentially free rein of the programmes I could install and the software I could use to day-to-day which meant, over the course of two years, I really managed to create a system which worked for me and genuinely felt more effective because of it.

I naively assumed this would be the case in most places and was surprised to find that, in my next company, it couldn't be more different. The only apps I was allowed to install came from the company's own, internal registry of "verified" software. Everything needs to be vetted by a security team to ensure it's safe to use alongside company data, and it has to have a business justification for why it's needed over any of the existing, approved programs.

Suddenly I can't use Obsidian to take work notes, I can't use Todoist to organise my tasks and stay on track. We're not even allowed to install *Spotify* on these machines.

I get why this policy is in place, but that doesn't stop me from finding it a bit disruptive and wishing I could just do everything *how I want it.* Now I have two entirely different systems for notes and tasks when comparing my work and personal life, and they're entirely disconnected from each other. Great stuff! 👍

Considering the notion of starting my own business and working for myself, even if it's just so I can use the software *I* want to use.
