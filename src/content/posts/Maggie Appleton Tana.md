Just watched [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) demo how she uses [Tana](https://tana.inc/) to organise all her stuff and felt a weird mix of awe and FOMO? I don't collect anywhere *near* enough data in my day-to-day life to need much of a system to organise it but I kinda wish I did? I love the idea of a Second Brain, all connected together to help me work better and organise my thoughts and interests. On the other hand, maybe it's just got a nice UI that I like and I'm trying to trick myself into *feeling* productive by setting up some kind of new system.
