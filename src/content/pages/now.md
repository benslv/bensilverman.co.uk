# /now

Still living in London, in the same flat. Crucially, though, I now live here with my girlfriend! We're taking over both bedrooms and I'm very much looking forward to seeing how we can use the space. I'm going to get to set up a bit more of a proper WFH space, too, which is going to be great.

I'm also still working at [Starling Bank](https://starlingbank.com)! It was quite surreal to pass the one-year mark recently, as there are still many days when I feel like a complete newbie. I'm learning a lot and, while I'm not doing quite as much frontend as I would like, I think/hope my current role will help me become a better developer overall.

As for reading, I just finished [Toll the Hounds](https://hardcover.app/books/toll-the-hounds), and have very quickly moved on to [Dust of Dreams](https://hardcover.app/books/dust-of-dreams). I've been working through this series for longer than I expected and am excited to be on the home straight. It's a very good story but also _very_ long.

Running was going quite well over the summer but I picked up a few injuries which stopped any progress for a good while. I'm looking to pick it up again slowly in the new year!
