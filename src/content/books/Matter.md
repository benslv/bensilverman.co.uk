8/10<br/><br/>I enjoyed this! It was wonderfully long and beautifully detailed, with a strong story leading the book forward - I've come to appreciate this as a lot because my experience with some Culture novels has been a lot more "wandering". I loved the juxtaposition of the two main characters in both their worlds: one, a super advanced Culture citizen with the best of technology at her disposal, and the other, living in an almost medieval setting fighting against a conspiracy so relatively tiny it wouldn't even register as a blip of interest on any of the higher-level civilisations in the universe.<br/><br/>I loved the dive into more lore, too. There was discussion and interaction with other Culture-sized civilisations, an expansion into the history of "The Involveds" and the species that came before it, the introduction of the Shellworlds - massive, multi-layer planets constructed by an ancient civilisation to house and nuture other fledging civilisations - and so much more.<br/><br/><i>Matter</i> is definitely a worthwhile read and a great addition to the Culture anthology.
