My favourite of the Wax & Wayne trilogy, definitely!<br/><br/>I thought it took a while for the story to really get going - mainly from the second-half onwards, I'd say - but once the wheels were in motion...<i>man</i> did they spin fast. So much character development for our main posse, and Sanderson treated us to some really good lore- and world-building, setting us up perfectly for a fourth and final book (which I was <b><i>very</i></b> to learn is in the works!)<br/><br/>Sanderson has quickly become one of my favourite authors, largely down to his ability to craft wonderful, intricate, enthralling fantasy worlds along with beautifully-written characters that I actually <i>want</i> to learn more about and <i>love</i> to see grow and develop as their stories progress.<br/><br/>Hats off!
