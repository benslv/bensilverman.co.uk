Sort of disappointed with how juvenile the writing in this book felt. None of the characters were particularly well fleshed-out, which meant I really struggled to sympathise with anything that happened to them, and their interactions with other people in the “chads and nerds” social hierarchy felt low-effort and pretty crass for the most part. <br/><br/>The concept was interesting, at least, although I probably would’ve preferred something slightly more detailed and intricate over the more surface-level, cheesy approach taken here.
