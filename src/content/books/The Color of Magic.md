7/10<br/><br/>It took me a little bit to get into Pratchett's style of writing, which was a bit more whimsical and less serious than I'm used to, but I really enjoyed it!<br/><br/>The story was light but by no means weak, and I think that just gave Pratchett the opportunity to explore the world on A'Tuin's back, including the gods that rule it and a little about the magic woven throughout it. <br/><br/>I look forward to reading a few more of the fourty-one(!!!) books, getting to know more of the characters more deeply!
