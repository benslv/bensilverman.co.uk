Definitely a testament to the book that I couldn’t really put it down and read it a lot quicker than my other recent books. The only thing holding it back from five stars, for me, is the relatively simple language used.<br/><br/>And Pierce Brown’s insistence on writing “do not” instead of “don’t” absolutely everywhere in the book was mildly irritating too
