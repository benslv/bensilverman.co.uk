	# Hi, I'm Ben!

	I'm passionate about all things frontend, and love the opportunities it provides to intersect development with design. If I'm not at my computer, you can probably find me at the gym, reading, or playing my saxophone in my local band! 🎷

	## Experience

	Right now I'm building [Max](https://max.com) as a software engineer at [Warner Bros. Discovery](https://wbd.com), focussing on high-performance code for smart TVs, set-top boxes, and games consoles.

	Before that I worked at [Arm](https://arm.com) on my industrial placement, implementing a component-driven architecture in React for Arm Developer Community, and writing backend Azure policies to introduce new functionality to Arm Account.
