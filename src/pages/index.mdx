# Hi, I'm Ben!

I'm passionate about all things frontend, and love the opportunities it provides to intersect development with design. If I'm not at my computer, you can probably find me at the gym, reading, or playing my saxophone in my local band! ðŸŽ·

## Experience

I'm currently a Full Stack Engineer at [Starling Bank](https://starlingbank.com), developing and maintaining the services that power our _Suggestions_ feature. I also build and improve tools on our Management Portal, a cross-departmental platform for Customer Engagement.

Previously I was at [Max](https://max.com) as a software engineer at [Warner Bros. Discovery](https://wbd.com), focussing on high-performance code for smart TVs, set-top boxes, and games consoles.

And before _that_ I worked at [Arm](https://arm.com) on my industrial placement, implementing a component-driven architecture in React for Arm Developer Community, and writing backend Azure policies to introduce new functionality to Arm Account.
