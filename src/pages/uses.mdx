<BaseLayout title="Uses">

I love reading everyone else's `/uses` pages and wanted to contribute my own!

*Updated 4th March, 2025*

- **Computer:** I use both my custom-built PC and a [2021 MacBook Pro](https://www.backmarket.co.uk/en-gb/p/macbook-pro-2021-14-inch-with-m1-pro-8-core-and-14-core-gpu-16gb-ram-ssd-512gb-qwerty-english-uk/1e1ec3c9-c221-4651-870c-74d2c8c28a3c). I've toyed with the idea of going laptop-only but I still play enough video games that having a powerful Windows machine is worth it. I also have a (extremely locked-down) work laptop; it's a pain to try and keep all three in sync.

- **Mouse:** [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07W6JJSV1). Honestly love this mouse, and being able to switch between three different connections is *extremely* helpful for me.

- **Headphones:** [Sony WH1000XM4](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4). The noise-cancelling is excellent and they're more than comfortable enough to wear for an entire day. I use AirPods Pro 2 at the office and around London because I'm too paranoid about somebody *yoinking* my headphones off my head in public.

- **Keyboard:** Built-in MacBook keyboard when using my laptop. Otherwise, I just use this [cheapo Arteck](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B073TSKFRX) keyboard for my desktop. I used to use a [Keychron K6](https://www.keychron.uk/products/keychron-k6-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-uk-iso-layout) but hated that the backtick was hidden on a layer behind the Esc key. The battery also didn't last long enough for me and I got fed up of charging it.

- **Editor:** Intellij for Java, and VSCode for everything else :)

- **Browser:** Firefox at the moment, but I'm looking around for something else due to their recent [privacy concerns](https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/02/mozilla_introduces_terms_of_use/).

- **Terminal:** [Ghostty](https://mitchellh.com/ghostty), because I'm a sucker for following trends and installing random apps. It's just as good as anything else I've used.

- **Reading:** Physical books. I love physical books! I also read on a [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-paperwhite-2024/dp/B0CFPWLGF2?) because I some of the [very big books](https://www.youtube.com/tenverybigbooks) I'm currently reading are too heavy/bulky to carry around. I (try to) keep my eBook library organised with [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).

- **Read-later & RSS:** [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) and [Lire](http://www.lireapp.com/), respectively. I'm looking at ways to consolidate the two but no other read-later apps I've found seem able to save links while offline and sync them later, which is a killer feature for me. I might move to Feedbin so I can view my RSS feeds in the browser ~~at work~~ too.
