# Now

_Updated 23rd April, 2025_

Currently living in London and working as a Software Engineer at [Starling](https://www.starlingbank.com/). I'm learning a lot of Java on the job while also getting to keep my frontend skills fresh.

It was a bit of an inactive start to the year but I'm finally getting back into running and going to the gym, too. It's amazing how much better it makes me feel, too.

## Reading

Currently reading [Reaper's Gale](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/459064.Reaper_s_Gale) by Steven Erikson. I've gradually been working through the [Malazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen) series (interspersed with other books) since mid-2023 and, I have to say, it's one of the best set of books I've ever read. I'd maybe like to write more about reading this series, because it's accidentally become quite a core part of my day-to-day life and has changed the way I think about reading, in some sense.

## Watching

I'm not really one for TV shows, but I watch a lot of [movies](https://letterboxd.com/benslv/). I stayed up to watch the Oscars again this year and had a great time predicting winners for the different categories!

## Listening

Really just completely obsessed with everything that [Ultimae Records](https://ultimae.bandcamp.com/) is putting out. I've got back into Drum & Bass, too, mainly for some added motivation when running.
